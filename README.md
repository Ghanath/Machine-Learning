## Overview
This project aims to address the growing problem of Spotted Lanternfly (SLF) spread. The design involves a system that uses cameras and Python's blob detection algorithm to identify SLF egg masses beneath train cars, with the goal of limiting their spread.

### The Problem
- Growing population and spread of the invasive Spotted Lanternfly.
- Spread abnormalities potentially caused by trains.

### Stakeholders
- Amtrak
- Septa
- Other Train Companies
- Local Farmers
- Plant Nurseries
- USDA
- General Public

## System Requirements
- Automated identification of egg clusters.
- Long-term wear capability.
- Remote data transfer.
- Quick data processing.
- Easy installation and usability.
- Fits within available space.

## Design Specifications
- Scan time, light wavelength, processing power, extreme temperature tolerance, installation simplicity, data transfer distance, field of view, material sustainability, light intensity, aperture size, focal length.

## Implementation
- Camera captures images of train cars.
- Images are processed using blob detection and Connected Component Analysis (CCA) method.
- Identification of egg masses and tagging of affected train cars.
- Software optimizes images and runs them through the algorithm for validation.

## Environmental, Economic, and Social Impact
- Protection of agriculture and hardwood industries.
- Prevention of native species endangerment.
- Reduction in pesticide use.
- Mitigation of economic impacts across various states.

## Future Work
- Refinement of the algorithm using additional scikit functions.
- Physical prototype development for field testing.

## Project Timeline
- Development and testing phases from February 19, 2023, to May 23, 2023.

## Team Responsibilities
- Samuel Skodi: Hardware setup and adjustment.
